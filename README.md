## Findings/Analysis 
I reveiwed the dataframe and sliced only the May 2020 portion because that was the timeframe we wanted to use to compare to the orignal dataframe itself to analyze trends. Then the monthly traffic trends were grouped in order to compare it to the original data. This data was then searched by seasonality trends using a heatmap and line graph to visualize these trends. This was then repeated for the "stock" and "revenue" resource files provided.
